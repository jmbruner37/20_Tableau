This analysis shows the growth from two periods on 2018. I wanted to tackle two question:
1. What are growth parameters in January and December?
2. Does this align with quarterly growth?

I found two interesting phenomenons while investigating growth in 2018:

1. The third quarter there was the most miles travelled
2. Van Vorst Park was the most popular station in the beginning of year and Hamilton park was the most popular at the end of the year.
